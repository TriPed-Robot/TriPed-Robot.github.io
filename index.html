<h1> Welcome to the TriPed Project </h1>

<p> The TriPed is a new three legged Robot, in development as a cooperation betweeb the <a href="https://www.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/ziti/en/institute/research/38-ziti-group/menue/560-automation-laboratory">Proaut lab</a>, he <a href="https://www.lorenzomasia.com/lab-and-people">aries lab</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.imt.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">Institute of Medical Device Technology </a> at the University of Stuttgart.</p>

<p>The System uses a new kind of decentralized approach where each leg is independent from the rest and they need to cooperate, like humans do,  by reading and responding to their subtle cues</p>
