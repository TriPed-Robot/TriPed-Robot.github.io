# History of the TriPed
The TriPed was first envisioned by Professor Badreddin in 2002 as a nonbiomimetic robot.
Meaning a robot, which unlike conventional walking machines, is not inspired by animals but instead the fundamental principles of walking.

It has 3 legs because that's all you need to stand stably. It doesn't have knees because those are only needed for crouching and climbing not walking itself.
The first theoretical research on the TriPed considered how such a system could feasibly walk.
The Original Version however was never build.

When in 2019 a new research cooperation between Professor Badreddins <a href="https://www.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/ziti/en/institute/research/38-ziti-group/menue/560-automation-laboratory">automation lab</a>, Professor Masias  <a href="https://www.lorenzomasia.com/lab-and-people">aries lab</a> and Professor Peter Potts 
<a href="https://www.imt.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">Institute of Medical Device Technology </a> had need for a demonstrator, a new version of the robot was disgned build by Peter Potts team and delivered to Heidelberg.
Since Professor Badreddin is now an emeritus, the new TriPed robot now serves as part of the Aries lab.
