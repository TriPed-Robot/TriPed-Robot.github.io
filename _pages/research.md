## Research Aim
<p>It is known that the rehabilitation phase after an operation is as important as the operation itself.<br>
In the case of major abdominal operations or longer periods of bed rest, the patient often has to learn to walk again.
As a consequence, patients are still dependent on crutches for weeks after the operation.<br>
 However, some patients might not be able to use them due to cognitive or arm inpairnments, and even if,these severely restrict their everyday life, 
 as the crutches prevent them from using their hands for other purposes.</p>

<p> The ultimate aim of this project is to develop autonomous crutches which lift those restrictions and help the patients regain a normal life.
The device should also be able to be used as a rehabilitation device which trains the patient how to walk again. </p>


## But why a Robot?
<p>
Traditioinal assistive devices model the human as some kind of operator whose commands should be followed <br>
This approach doenst work for automatic cruchtes, consider for example the cases of walking and stumbling. The machine should allow and facilitate the first kind of movement but prohibit the second type.
Thus the human can no longer be thought of as an operator but as an equal player cooperating with the machine. </p> 

<p> Which is why we need to understand cooperation between different agents first, before we can develop autonomous cruchtes. <br>
This is where the triped comes in. The Robotic plattform allows us to study the principles of cooperative walking.
This encompasses what kind of sensory information each player needs as well as how a player can evaluate the actions of the other players in terms of their intention and safety
