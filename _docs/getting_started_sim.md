## Getting Matlab

The simulation runs in matlab version 2021a.
Unfortunately matlab is neither open source nor free, however if you are a student a lot of universities will supply you with a liscense for free.


Checkout Matlabs [website](https://de.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html) to find out if you are elligable


## Getting the Code

The simulation can be installed from Github by calling
```
git clone https://github.com/TriPed-Robot/Matlab-Simulation.git
```

In a terminal, or klicking on the green button labeled `Code` to download a zip archive.


## Using the Library

You can either directly use the library by starting the simulink package `TripedLibrary.slx` and dragging the needet files from the simulink model into you own projects.

However the better solution would be to properly install the library by following the following [tutorial](https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/adding-libraries-to-the-library-browser.html).




## Trying the Examples

The examples directory contains a number of examples to familirazie oneself with the robot and play around with it.
